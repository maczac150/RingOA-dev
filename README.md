# RingOA
Ring-Based Oblivious Access via Distributed Point Functions (DPFs)  
Implementation of the RingOA protocol described in our paper:  
> Tomoki Uchiyama and Kana Shimizu, RingOA: Ring-Based Oblivious Access for Large-Scale Databases and Practical Applications.

RingOA is a three-party oblivious access protocol that combines replicated secret sharing (RSS) over rings with 1-bit DPFs and supports early termination optimization.  
It enables efficient retrieval from billion-entry secret-shared databases while eliminating costly share conversions for subsequent arithmetic computations.  
Applications include the Oblivious Rank Dictionary and Fully Oblivious Full-Text Search using succinct data structures.

## Requirements
- Compiler: `gcc` / `g++` ≥ 11
- C++ standard: C++20
- OS: Tested on Linux (x86_64)
- Dependencies:
  - [cryptoTools](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools) and its prerequisites
  - CMake ≥ 3.16
  - Python ≥ 3.8

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and build with the provided Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/u-tmk/RingOA
cd RingOA
python build.py --setup
```

This will:
- Fetch and build required third-party libraries (including cryptoTools)
- Generate CMake build files
- Compile all targets

---

## Running Tests

Unit tests for RingOA and related components can be run via:

```bash
python build.py
./out/build/<platform>/bin/test_RingOA -u
```

Replace `<platform>` with the build directory name generated by CMake (e.g., `linux`).

Run without arguments to see available options:

```bash
./out/build/<platform>/bin/test_RingOA
```
