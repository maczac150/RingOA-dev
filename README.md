Ring-Based Oblivious Access via Distributed Point Functions (DPFs)  

---

## Requirements
- Compiler: `gcc` / `g++` ≥ 11
- C++ standard: C++20
- OS: Tested on Linux (x86_64)
- Dependencies:
  - [cryptoTools](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools) and its prerequisites
  - [SDSL](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl) (for succinct data structures)
- CMake ≥ 3.18
- Python ≥ 3.6 (for build script)
- Ninja (optional, for faster builds)

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and build with the provided Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/u-tmk/RingOA-dev
cd RingOA-dev
python build.py --setup
```

This will:
- Fetch and build required third-party libraries (including cryptoTools)
- Generate CMake build files
- Compile all targets

---

## Running Tests

Unit tests for RingOA and related components can be run via:

```bash
python build.py
./out/build/<platform>/bin/test_RingOA -u
```

Replace `<platform>` with the build directory name generated by CMake (e.g., `linux`).

Run without arguments to see available options:

```bash
./out/build/<platform>/bin/test_RingOA
```
